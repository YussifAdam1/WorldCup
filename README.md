# WorldCup
I developed an interactive World Cup dashboard featuring historical records from 1930 to 2014, designed for football enthusiasts and analysts. As a passionate football fan, this personal project was both exciting and insightful, allowing me to explore and visualize key trends, team performances, and tournament statistics over the years.
